CSE185 Spring 2018 Final Project Assignment

The file `cse185-spring18-final-projects.md` contains instructions for the final project. In addition, follow the guidelines below for filling out your lab notebook each week:

* Week 8:
Tuesday: list at least 3 datasets you're interested in (accession #'s and a brief description)
Thursday: one sentence about the biological question for the dataset you chose; also sign up for lightning talks

* Weeks 9 and 10:
Each day, document the steps you've tried to answer your question. Also include things you worked on but don't end up getting included. Similarly to lab notebooks throughout the quarter, you can include code, notes, and snippets of results to help you remember what you did and keep track of the results you will include in your report. You should have an entry for each date. If you work on your project outside of lab, you should keep entries for that as well for your records.
